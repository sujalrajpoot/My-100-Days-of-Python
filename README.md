**⭐ If you find this helpful, give it a star on GitHub!**

If you want, I can also make you a **fancier README** with **badges**, **progress bars**, and even a **day-by-day table** showing completion.  
That would make your repo look *super professional*.  

Do you want me to make that enhanced version?
